### Titanic Survival Prediction
This project utilizes machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

#### Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that answers the question: "Did this passenger survive the Titanic disaster?" We use a dataset of passenger information provided by Kaggle to train and test our model.

#### Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
